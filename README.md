# Restify

This repository contains the coursework of CSC309H1: Programming on the Web (Winter 2023) at the University of Toronto.

The `group_project` folder contains an implementation of an Airbnb-like app called Restify, which is an online marketplace where users can search, book, comment and rate short term lodging experiences. Additionally, property owners can create listings for their rental units (e.g., room, house, etc) and accept reservations from users. The project is divided into 3 phases:
* P1: UI Design (HTML/CSS, Bootstrap)
* P2: Django REST API
* P3: React Frontend

The `assignments` folder contains 3 assignments that were completed individually:  
* A1: HTML/CSS
* A2: Django
* A3: JavaScript (jQuery)
